# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera

**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction

This repo contains all my programming assignments. I transcripted all the problems to google colab to being everything more reproducible.

##  Â¿What is colab?

Google **colab** is a free cloud service (jupyter as service) with GPU and TPU support.
